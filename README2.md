## Tech Stack

### Frontend built using:

- React.js
- Material UI
- GraphQL
- Netlify

Deployed [here](https://www.myautoinvoicer.com)

### Backend built using:

- GraphQL
- MongoDB/Mongoose
- Node & Express

Deployed [here](https://www.myautoinvoicer.com)

### Reasoning:

- React.js / Context

  - We selected React as our frontend framework because we wanted a fast and efficient framework to help us manage many reusable components interacting with each other. We are using Context to allow us to manage state, without the setup required in Redux.

* Material UI

  - Our application targets small businesses so we wanted a styling framework that would be straight-forward, clean and minimal. Material UI allows us to style our application to give our users a professional experience.

- GraphQL

  - Our team has been excited to make this application with GraphQL from the start. We wanted to provide our users with a wealth of information regarding their invoices so we knew they would need to make multiple requests to the server. GraphQL allows us to query the data more efficiently. Moreover, data would change over time and editing queries and mutations in GraphQL is much simpler than rewriting REST endpoints.

* Netlify

  - Given that we were already experimenting with newer technologies on the backend (GraphQL, Mongoose), we wanted to deploy using a platform we were familiar with.

- GraphQL

  - We knew we wanted to provider users, busy business owners, with a seamless experience by making it easy for them to save and query customer and company data. Using GraphQL in lieu of REST has made the communication between client and server more efficient.

* MongoDB/Mongoose

  - We wanted a database that would allow us to store information as JSON objects for efficient querying. MongoDB allow our application to scale, if that is necessary in the future.

* Node & Express

  - We are with Node and Express and it works well with GraphQL.

# Security

### Authentication:

Our application has users authenticate with Google and Facebook Login. These are secure authentication systems that enabled our users, small business owners to sign in with their Google or Facebook account. As an added bonus, premium users will also to send information from the application to their Google accounts.

### Authorization:

Authorization is handled on the model level, with each model query checking to see if the requesting party is a free or premium user, restricting access certain privileges, and filtering responses to limit access to only those items the particular requesting party has created.

### Form Validation

Form validation is handled at the component level with Material-UI.
